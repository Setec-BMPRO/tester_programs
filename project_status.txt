Tester Programs project status
==============================

1st generation test programs used these constructional elements:

    SubStep classes may be used in test programs.

    A collection of global variables, which can be identified by the lines at
    the top of the program:
    >   # These are module level variables...
    >   d = s = m = t = None

====

2nd generation test programs used these constructional elements:

    SubStep classes may be used in test programs.

    Global variables are replaced by "@oldteststep" decorators on test steps
    to provide the (LogicalDevice, Measurement) arguments to the test steps.

====

3rd generation test programs used these constructional elements:

    "@oldteststep" decorators are replaced by "@teststep" decorators on test
    steps to provide the (LogicalDevice, Measurement) arguments to the test steps.

    A "share.TestSequence" class to manage the LogicalDevice/Sensor/Measurement
    instances.

    SubStep classes are deprecated and replaced by methods on share.TestSequence.
